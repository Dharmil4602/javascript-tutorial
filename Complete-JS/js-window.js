// The window interface is home to a variety of functions, namespaces, objects, and constructors which are not necessarily directly associated with the concept of a user interface window.
// Window and window are different in JavaScript

let w = window.document; // window is global variable
// let w = window; // window is global variable

w = window.innerHeight;
w = window.innerWidth;
w = window.location; // by not writing window, we can also perform various activities by just declaring it.

w = location;
w = location.href;
w = location.reload;
w = history;
console.log(w);
